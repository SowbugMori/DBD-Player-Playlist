# DBD-Player-Playlist
Collection of albums chosen by Dead by Daylight players.


## How do you collect music?
I ask players what their favorite album is after a match.


## What if I'm console?
Create an Issue and I'll add it! If you're a streamer on console & you're live, I will ask in your chat.


## Why are you doing it through games?
No reason in particular other than being interested in what DBD players enjoy listening to!


## What are you doing with the music?
I'll compile it into a spotify/youtube playlist so you can listen to what the community enjoys!


## How often will the playlist be updated?
The playlists are gonna be updated weekly, most likely saturday evenings


## What if my favorite album isn't on spotify (or youtube)
You may have to refer to using the other playlist, or choose a different album if you already know its not on a certain platform.


## Where can I find the playlists?
You can find them here!
(Currently not present because I'm still compiling)
